          <cite>Schmalholz, Deborah Wielgot. “American Pathfinders: Using Ray Bradbury’s ‘Martian Chronicles’ to Teach
            Frontier History.” OAH Magazine of History, vol. 13, no. 2, 1999, pp. 44–48. JSTOR,

          <p>The Martian Chronicles are a series of short stories about human colonization of Mars, and
            the interactions between humans and the indigenous Martians. The relationship between humans and Martians is
            analogous to the encounters between Europeans and Native Americans during the colonization of North America.
            Bradbury depicts the cultural clash that accompanies colonization, detailing how Martian cities are renamed
            to reflect human domination. Cities are rebranded as “Detroit II”, “Aluminum City” or “Electric village”.
            Beyond addressing the ethics of imperialism, Bradbury also writes about an exodus of Africans from Earth to
            Mars, seeking escape from systemic racism. The social flux in The Martian Chronicles is an example of
            Kilgore’s ‘Difference Engine’ (see annotated bibliography). While race may have been the great dividing line
            of society previously, now the battle lines are drawn around who is human and who is not. Ultimately,
            humanity’s colonization of Mars shakes up established divisions of society, bringing previously
            disenfranchised groups such as Africans, while creating a new lower class of beings — the Martians.
            Parallels can be drawn to how previously repressed groups in Europe — Puritans, Quakers, or economic
            refugees — became prosperous in the New World, their spots in the social hierarchy replaced by Native
            Americans or Africans. In The Martian Chronicles, Bradbury effectively depicts how new frontiers can shake
            up old social structures, while instituting new ones that aren’t any better.</p>

          <p>The Three-Body Problem is a science fiction book set in the context of Mao’s Cultural
            Revolution, a period of acute social turmoil. Intellectuals were persecuted as ‘reactionaries’ and perceived
            as threats to the Chinese Communist Party. At Tsinghua University, a physicist is beaten to death by a mob
            of youth activists. His daughter, named Ye Wenjie, develops strong feelings of misanthropy after this
            traumatic event. She is exiled to a labor camp in Western China, where she works at a clandestine radio
            installation maintained by the military. Here, Wenjie discovers a way to use the sun as an antenna and uses
            it to broadcast the location of Earth, the signal propagating at light speed. She believes there is
            intelligent life in the universe, and that it will come to Earth to conquer it in response to the signal.
          </p>
          <p>60 years later, it is discovered that aliens called Trisolarans have heard the signal, and have assembled
            an invasion fleet to colonize Earth. The Trisolarans live in a trinary star system which exhibits chaotic
            behavior typical of a three-body system. There is no solution to the three-body problem, so the Trisolarans
            live in constant uncertainty about the survival of their planet. Liu depicts Trisolaran society as a command
            and control system, with very little respect for individual rights and placing the survival of the
            civilization above all else. The departure from classic sci-fi tropes can be found in the timescale; the
            Trisolaran fleet is 400 years away. Liu’s exploration of how human society changed over four centuries is
            one of the most captivating aspects of his works. Liu imagines that humanity will go through phases of
            radical militarization and feminization among others. His depiction of the feminization of humanity is
            particularly problematic because he portrays that phase of human society as weak and in denial. Elements of
            misogyny can be seen throughout his works (Zhang). A solution to deter the Trisolarans is eventually found
            which relies on a single person with their finger on the equivalent of a nuclear bomb that will destroy both
            humans and Trisolarans alike. A man successfully holds the position with no incidents for more than 50
            years, but as soon as a woman gains the position, the Trisolarans attack, believing that the woman is too
            compassionate to destroy both civilizations. Liu’s depiction of women as the voice of morality, unable to do
            what is needed, is contrasted with his portrayal of men as coldly rational.</p>
          <p>Two assumptions are central to the book’s premise: (1) Survival is the primary goal of civilization, and
            (2) Civilizations grow and expand, but the total matter in the universe is constant. From these two
            ‘self-evident’ axioms, Liu develops the idea of the ‘chain of suspicion’ (猜疑链) and a solution to the Fermi
            Paradox, the famous ‘dark forest’ theory (黑暗森林). This theory states that civilizations that come into
            contact with each other must inevitably attack each other, because it is impossible to know whether the
            other will be hostile or not. Liu paints a picture of the universe as a collection of silent, cold-blooded
            alien cultures trying to remain hidden while killing off those weaker than them. In his novel, Liu expounds
            a worldview of social Darwinism,
            where the strongest cultures survive and might makes right. This idea has gained popularity in China. In
            particular, hawkish factions of Chinese society known as the Industrial Party (工业党), have used Liu’s works
            to ridicule morality and rail against progressive social change (Zhang). In short, Liu's depiction of the
            universe is a reflection of attitudes at home. This gives him a way to circumvent the Chinese Censorate,
            allowing him to discuss sensitive social issues while maintaining plausible deniability. According to
            Michaelson(see bibliography), this technique is extremely commonplace within social science fiction. Liu's
            works, while imperfect, give readers valuable insights into Chinese thought and geopolitics.</p>

        <h2>Social Criticism in Science Fiction</h2>
        <cite>L. W. Michaelson. “Social Criticism in Science Fiction.” The Antioch Review, vol. 14, no. 4, 1954, pp.
          502–08. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/4609758. Accessed 14 Dec. 2024.</cite>
        <p>Michaelson’s article explores the role of science fiction as a tool to criticize social issues, tracing its
          roots back to satirists like Jonathan Swift and Voltaire. The article argues that science fiction often
          critiques humanity’s flaws by comparing Earth with imagined superior civilizations or cultures. This allows
          authors to address sensitive issues indirectly, concealing social criticisms in the camouflage of aliens and
          ray guns. This tradition can be seen as far back as Gulliver’s Travels, protecting the authors from immediate
          public censure. Michaelson then moves on to contemporary authors such as Ray Bradbury and Kurt Vonnegut, who
          grapple with themes such as cultural decline, technological flux, and institutional rigidity. Their works are
          often pessimistic about modern civilization, often imagining social collapse as the consequence of humanity’s
          contradictions. However, some authors use science fiction to portray advancements and reforms, provoking
          reflection on current issues while maintaining hope that the future will be better.</p>
        <p>This article discusses overall themes and camps within the realm of science fiction social commentary. One
          one side, some authors paint a bleak picture of the future, featuring social collapse and anarchy. Others
          depict utopian worlds, in contrast to today’s unequal and problematic world. In both cases, authors are using
          imagined worlds to contrast with our current world, highlighting the need to reform or improve. Our
          presentation must ensure that both camps are fairly represented. In particular, books by Kurt Vonnegut and Ray
          Bradbury—some of the most influential authors in 20th century science fiction—should be included in our
          collection. The article compares social science fiction with the works of satirists such as Swift, so we
          should also explore the satirical nature of science fiction in addition to more overt criticisms.</p>

        <h2>Difference Engine: Aliens, Robots, and Other Racial Matters in the History of Science Fiction</h2>
        <cite>De Witt Douglas Kilgore. “Difference Engine: Aliens, Robots, and Other Racial Matters in the History of
          Science Fiction.” Science Fiction Studies, vol. 37, no. 1, 2010, pp. 16–22. JSTOR,
          http://www.jstor.org/stable/40649582. Accessed 4 Jan. 2025.
        </cite>
        <p>In his discussion of science fiction, Kilgore analyzes how race and racism are portrayed in science fiction.
          In early science fiction, authors often envision a post-racial future, depicting a society where race is
          irrelevant. These works are optimistic about the future of humanity, imagining a more egalitarian society. In
          contrast, contemporary science fiction either maintains race as the fundamental divider of society, or
          replaces it with other divisions. Alterity, or “otherness”, continues to be a source of tension or conflict
          within these societies. Instead of discrimination based on race, contemporary science fiction authors imagine
          discrimination based on planets of origin, against clones or replicants, or against cyborgs. Kilgore argues
          that the metaphorization of race within science fiction allows it to operate as a medium to critique and
          rethink social structures, alterity, or ethics.
        </p>
        <p>For the purposes of analysis and curation within our website, this article provides a scholarly perspective
          on how discrimination is portrayed and critiqued within science fiction. Examples of discrimination not based
          on race can be found in multiple works that we selected. In The Expanse by James S.A. Corey, ‘Belters’ —
          space-faring humans — are pitted against ‘Earthers’ and Martians. One of the major conflicts in the series is
          a war between the Belt and the Inner Planets — Earth and Mars. In Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card, xenophobia
          among humans ultimately leads to xenocide, wiping out an alien species known as the Formics. Fear and hatred
          of the other is a common theme throughout literature as a whole, but science fiction manufactures
          never-before-seen divisions, allowing readers to approach the issue with no biases.

          2018, pp. 420–32. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.5621/sciefictstud.45.3.0420. Accessed 5 Jan. 2025.</cite>
        <p>In this article, the author speaks about the connection between modern science fiction and the increased
          references relating to climate change. This is done by authors to express to the readers the danger that
          climate change poses to our environment. The author uses examples from 1960-1970 China where Chinese authors
          were making specific references to their local climate to express optimism about Mao Zedong's efforts to
          “conquer nature”. Despite the optimistic thoughts of the Chinese authors, the author of this article focuses
          more on the activist-like mindset of the authors writing about climate change through their works. This work
          theorizes that modern science fiction focuses much more on climate change because of the pressing matters
          being faced in today's world. It is also speculated that science fiction relating to climate change should be
          put in its category due to the factual nature of the work.</p>
        <p>For analysis and curation within our website, this article helps to further explain the connection between
          activism in social and political issues that can be found in works such as those of Ray Bradbury and George
          Orwell to help explain why both the people and the government need to do their part to create a more stable
          and safe environment for everybody. The work of The Veldt by Ray Bradbury expresses how people cannot become
          too reliant on one singular thing and the work of 1984 shows how the government must not take a stance that is
          too strong and therefore must listen to the people to rule efficiently and effectively. The article supports
          the idea that changes in social climate can greatly alter the contents of science fiction works.</p>

          https://doi.org/10.5621/sciefictstud.40.3.0510. Accessed 5 Jan. 2025.</cite>
        <p>Dougherty’s article shows how the internet has played a crucial role in the evolution of science fiction. In
          this work, he speaks about the connection between humans and technology. He does this by citing examples of
          science fiction works that utilize characters who interact with AI/ the internet. These include Wake, New
          Model Army, etc. The author uses the article to show how different authors have portrayed new technological
          advances to be both negative and positive towards society. Many of the works listed in the article are used to
          show how technology can lead to less democracy and less freedom for the people. The work also references the
          media’s influence on the control of other people and how it functions as activism for more freedom of press to
          increase democracy.
        </p>
        <p>For analysis and curation of our website, this article will be used to better show the connection between
          societal change and the influences that that has on science fiction works. This article will pertain to the
          works of The Veldt, 1984, and The Time Machine to show how technological advancement can heavily alter the
          purposes of science fiction writing. Through this article we can more deeply understand the fears of authors
          who were writing during the early stages of the technological era and gain new understanding to how many of
          the authors felt that this would alter future generations and governmental control. The article helps to give
          authors like H.G Wells and George Orwell a new lens and helps to show how governmental control is a huge fear
          as cameras and forms of surveillance become more popular.</p>

        <h2>Science Fiction and Critical Theory</h2>

          de La Critique).” Science Fiction Studies, vol. 14, no. 2, 1987, pp. 180–200. JSTOR,
          http://www.jstor.org/stable/4239815. Accessed 5 Jan. 2025.</cite>
        <p>This article written by Carl Freedman explains the connection between critical theory and science fiction.
          The article shows how science fiction activism often uses many different issues to protest social climates.
          This article shows how authors often choose issues and themes based on the social issues of that time. Authors
          who had careers during the women's suffrage movement or wars would focus on ways to show the readers how
          change can be created. Similarly, authors who are born in a certain part of the world will be more likely to
          focus on issues in that area. Critical theory as explained by Carl Freedman is used by the author to show how
          social issues are perceived when used in science fiction works. Carl Freedman also states that he believes
          that third world countries do not possess true science fiction works because of the social state in these
          countries and therefore how authors from third world countries express feelings of social injustice are vastly
          different than authors in other countries.
        </p>
        <p>For the analysis and curation of our website, we will use this article to help explain how critical theory
          plays a role in influencing the writing of science fiction authors. This can help to explain why the authors
          that we listed in our book summaries have decided to write about the issues that they have written about. We
          can also use this article to help articulate to the viewers of the website why the author's emotions and
          personal feelings have played a role in the work and how it can positively impact the importance of the work
          or the message that the author was attempting to get across to the reader.</p>
